# My attempt to create the IDEAL KEYBOARD LAYOUT

You may want to run `sbs_evaluate.py`first, and run `search.py` to find out your new layout after:

1. Changing `text` in `sbs_evaluate.py` to configure what kind of sentences you want to use to evaluate the layout.(The default texts will take some much time...)

2. Blush up parameters at `create_cost2()` in `sbs_calc.py` to make the method better.
